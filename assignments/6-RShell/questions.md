1. How does the remote client determine when a command's output is fully received from the server, and what techniques can be used to handle partial reads or ensure complete message transmission?

The remote client can determine when a command's output is fully received from the server when the server sends a message with a header that contains the size of the message. Some techniques that can be used to handle partial reads or ensure complete message transmission are using buffered reads. The client reads data in chunks and appends them to a buffer. If the size of the buffer doesn't match the header, it will keep waiting for more chunks to append to the buffer.  

2. This week's lecture on TCP explains that it is a reliable stream protocol rather than a message-oriented one. Since TCP does not preserve message boundaries, how should a networked shell protocol define and detect the beginning and end of a command sent over a TCP connection? What challenges arise if this is not handled correctly?

A networked shell protocal should define and detect the beginning and end of command sent over a TCP connection by adding delimiters to denote the end of a command or include a header that indicates the size of a message.

3. Describe the general differences between stateful and stateless protocols.

Stateful protocols are able to remember previous interactions and use them for context in subsequent messages. It maintains information about the current state of the communication session between the client and server. Stateless protocols are simpler because they don't employ these tecnhiques. 

4. Our lecture this week stated that UDP is "unreliable". If that is the case, why would we ever use it?

UDP is faster and more effecient than TCP. It doesn't require ensuring delivery, sequencing, or error correction. This is useful in situations where some data loss in acceptable, but speed is reuqired. 

5. What interface/abstraction is provided by the operating system to enable applications to use network communications?

Sockets are the interface/abstraction provided by the operating system. It allows applications to send and receive data over networks using TCP, UDP, etc.
